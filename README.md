# Company-Name-Standardization
Using Natural Language Processing to standardize Company Names

# Introduction
Problem Statement is to standardize a list of similar company names **(JPMC, JPMorgan, J.P.Morgan Chase)** to their standard name **JPMorgan Chase & Co.**
We could have used traditional string matching approaches like ***Levenshtein Distance*** for string matching but they are really slow for large datasets.
